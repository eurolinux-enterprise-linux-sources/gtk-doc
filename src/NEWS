GTK-Doc 1.8     (Feb 16 2007)
===========

 o Made it easier to include example code in the source code comment blocks.
   "|[ ... ]|" can be used to delineate example code (it just gets converted
   to "<informalexample><programlisting>"), and most of the text in example
   code is left as it is. The only thing that is still expanded is
   '#' to allow links to a symbol's documentation, e.g. '#GtkWidget'.
 o Made the field widths wider for the HTML output, so it looks a bit nicer.
 o Added a '--rebuild-sections' option to gtkdoc-scan to automatically rebuild
   the MODULE-sections.txt file. This only works if all the header files are
   organized neatly and functions don't need rearranging in the docs.
 o Added a '--rebuild-types' option to gtkdoc-scan to automatically rebuild
   the MODULE.types file, so you don't need to add new types manually.
 o Leave CDATA sections as they are, in the extra XML content files and within
   source code comment blocks.
 o Allow the section id and #include's to be set within the "SECTION:" comment
   block, using "@Section_ID:xxx" and "@Include:".
 o Added "--default-includes" option to specify the default #include's (for
   people who are using --rebuild-sections and so can't specify it in
   MODULE-sections.txt).
 o Added a '--query-child-properties' argument to help document child
   properties of arbitrary GObjects (used by things like canvas widgets).
 o Fixed documentation of signals of interfaces.


GTK-Doc 1.7     (Jul 29 2006)
===========

 o Fixed bug that resulted in empty "@:" lines in the templates.
 o Fixed a few bugs with the XSL code.
 o Supported a few more variations of C syntax.
 o Remove the internally-used '-struct' suffix from links to widget structs.
 o Fixed a few missing build dependencies.
 o Added a new "C-x4s" binding to the emacs lisp code, to insert a blank
   section header in the source code.
 o Fixed bug that ignored inline section header docs with '-' in their names.
 o Added a 'make docs' target that can be used to build the docs even when
   gtk-doc has been disabled at configure time.


GTK-Doc 1.6     (Apr 9 2006)
===========

 o Removed the hard dependancy on openjade or jade, since XML is used mainly
   now rather than SGML.
 o Install the .pc file in $(datadir) rather than $(libdir) since gtk-doc is
   architecture-independant.
 o Added "--ignore-decorators" option to ignore a list of declarators in
   function declarations.
 o Support '#Object::signal'/'#Object:property' to link to signals/properties
 o Fixed missing index terms.


GTK-Doc 1.5     (Mar 7 2006)
===========

 o Output the new version of devhelp2 information, but still generate the old
   devhelp files so older versions of DevHelp still work OK.
 o Fixed the initial creation of the *-sections.txt file so the object
   hierarchy, signals and properties all work automatically.
 o Show information about signal flags (run first/last).
 o Support a --source-suffixes argument specifying which source files to scan.
 o Support other root object types besides GObject and GInterface.
 o Use a fixed navigation bar for the generated documentation.
 o New documentation from Stefan Kost.
 o Handle more variations of C syntax.


GTK-Doc 1.4     (Jul 3 2005)
===========

 o Support section documentation (title, short description, long description
   and 'see also') within the source code. I think everything can now be
   documented within the source code.
 o Support Stable/Unstable/Private stability levels for everything.


GTK-Doc 1.3     (Jan 9 2005)
===========

 o Use the new style.css stylesheet instead of hard-wiring the styles.
 o Updated the documentation and example build files.
 o Added support for a gallery of widget images.
 o Output default values for widget properties and allowed ranges.
 o Only underline links in the docs when the mouse hovers over them.
 o Added support for placing the parameter table anywhere within the function
   documentation (using the "<!--PARAMETERS-->" marker).
 o Handle more variations of C syntax.


GTK-Doc 1.2     (Feb 16 2004)
===========

 o Added widget signals and properties to undocumented output and statistics.
 o Added support for an index of all symbols.
 o Emit "Since:" information for signals and properties.
 o Added derived subclasses and interfaces to the widget hierarchies.
 o Added .cat SGML catalog file.
 o Support properties on interfaces. 
 o Added "--help" options to the scripts.


GTK-Doc 1.1     (Apr 18 2003)
===========

 o Add a gtk-doc.m4 macro that allows packages to provide consistent
   checking for gtk-doc.
 o Check to make sure that the XML catalog actually contains entries
   for the DocBook XML DTD and XSLT stylesheets.  Please consult the
   README file if your system's XML catalog isn't set up.
 o Add infrastructure for including the standard gtk-doc makefile
   glue, so that maintainers of packages don't need to worry about
   keeping it up to date.  See glib head for an example of its use.
 o Some updates to the devhelp contents file generation, as suggested
   by Hallski.
 o Fix some bugs in the DocBook XML codepath that were preventing
   inter-module cross references from being resolved.
 o Fix some bugs in extraction of object property documentation.


GTK-Doc 1.0	(Jan 20 2003)
===========

 o Added support for "Since:" and "Deprecated:" tags, and look for deprecated
   guard macros in header files.
 o Support /*< public >*/ and /*< private >*/ markers for all structs.
 o New "--ignore-files" option for gtkdoc-mkdb, to ignore files or directories.
 o Used the "sgml-raw" output type with openjade, to avoid problems with Lynx.
 o Added .pc pkg-config file which can be used to check the gtk-doc version.


GTK-Doc 0.10	(Nov 14 2002)
============

 o --output-format option to select whether SGML or XML is generated. 
 o Use openjade or jade when converting SGML to HTML.
 o Use xsltproc to convert XML to HTML, with a new look.
 o In XML mode, support XIncludes as an alternative to entities.
 o In XML mode, create .devhelp files. 
 o List interfaces in the object hierarchy.
 o Create docs for signals on interfaces.
 o Generate links between interface and their implementations and
   prerequisites.
 o Create docs for child and style properties.
 o Use blurbs for property documentation.
 o Allow inline documentation for signals and properties.
